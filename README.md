# Learn TDD (Test Driven Development)
This Repo is intended to serve as a reference for Test Driven Development approach to software development

### Problems Faced

While moving from academia to industry, we found that writing test cases is critically important. There are obvious commercial reasons for it, 
one of the foremost is, in software lifecycle, software maintenance accounts for over 60% of the costs, and TDD helps in lowering that costs.
So while learning to implement TDD, we found that there aren't enough examples available both in terms of quality and in quantity to master this topic.

### Our proposed solution

A documentaion with lots of examples implementing TDD. This repository shall include implementation of Data Structures, Algorithms and Projects 
using TDD approach.

### File and Folder Structure
